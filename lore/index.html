<p>R74n projects are connected to reality, which you are currently reading this in, through an ongoing series of events spanning countless universes and advanced civilizations. Also see <a href="../meta/">About R74n</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Multiverse">The Multiverse</h3>
<p>A universe can be any kind of reality. It may or may not look like <a href="#OurUniverse">our own</a>.</p>
<hr>

<!-- <h3>Multiversal Constants</h3>
<p>These concepts exist across most, if not all, universes.</p>
<p>R74n Epoch Time = Current UNIX (ms) - 1493764957055</p> -->
<!-- <p>Total Milliseconds since R74n Epoch / (Timeflow per s * 1000)</p> -->
<!-- <p>Relative Timeflow Rate = 1 / (Units per ms)</p>
<p>Relative R74n Epoch Time = R74n Epoch Time * Relative Timeflow Rate</p> -->

<h3 id="OurUniverse">Our Universe</h3>
<p>This is where you reside, probably.</p>
<p>Locations of Relevance: Earth (Planet), home of the R74n Vault.</p>
<!-- <p>Relative Timeflow Rate: 1</p> -->
<p>The R74n Vault can detect and read interversal signals, but cannot transmit any. Since Sandbloxians have never made contact with Our Universe due to lack of interest, we have never learned to travel through the multiverse, and therefore have no influence on it.</p>
<p>Contains all ants from <a href="../ants/">Every Ant on Earth</a>.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="Boxelverse">Boxelverse</h3>
<p>Manifestation of: <a href="https://sandboxels.r74n.com/">Sandboxels</a>.</p>
<!-- <p>Relative Timeflow Rate: 0.000033333333333333335</p> -->
<p>Original universe of the Sandbloxians, a highly advanced godlike civilization capable of multiversal travel.</p>
<p>The Sandbloxians are the earliest known instance of a civilization discovering and controlling the multiverse.</p>
<p>Upon creation of a Mirror Portal to their Mirror Boxelverse, research began into other universes.</p>
<p>Through multiversal travel, expeditions can be made to unlimited universes in order to retrieve any imaginable material or tool, a manifestation of <a href="https://sandboxels.R74n.com/mod-list">mods</a>.</p>
<p>This lead to rapid advancement, mass harvesting of dimensions, and infinite energy.</p>
<p>Trade routes and diplomatic relations were established between the Boxelverse and other universes.</p>
<p>Once the Sandbloxians surpassed any possible threat, they began transmitting themselves to every universe.</p>
<p>Before this, no other universes had discovered the multiverse.</p>
<p>Each Sandboxels session takes place on an oxygenated 'zoo planet', in which the experimenter is given a genetically modified, dumbed-down subspecies of Human.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="MirrorBoxelverse">Mirror Boxelverse</h3>
<p>Derivative universe of the <a href="#Boxelverse">Boxelverse</a>. Relative positions are flipped across the X and Y axes, affecting the behavior of Light and appearing chromatically inverted.</p>
<p>Mirror Portals can be made to enter and exit the Mirror Boxelverse, but they are destroyed upon use.</p>
<p>About half of all universes should have a mirrorverse.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="Amalgaverse">Amalgaverse</h3>
<p>Manifestation of: Everything.</p>
<p>Converse (constructed universe) originating from the Boxelverse.</p>
<p>Attempts to combine known universes into an individual conglomerate.</p>
<p>Ripples can be detected across all of spacetime in unique ways for each universe, taking the form of <a href="old#Emanations">emanations</a> on Earth.</p>
<p>These emanations alluded that R74n was deeply connected with an unexplained force in the universe.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="Shapeverse">Shapeverse</h3>
<p>Manifestation of: <a href="../shapes/">Shapes</a>.</p>
<p>Composed entirely of Shapes of different sizes and colors.</p>
<p>Locations of Relevance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infinite Chef planet, dominated by diverse, primitive but conscious lifeforms, Dolls, which never advanced past their own planet. Also contains other life, such as Fish and Squid.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="Halacae">Moo-oo</h3>
<p>In a universe very similar to our own, the <a href="../halacae/">Halacae</a> language developed on planet Moo-oo.</p>
<p>The Halacaeha are an intelligent humanoid species, but are not very advanced.</p>
<p>Language started by making random sounds as reactions, eventually conflating certain sounds with concepts that pertain to their surroundings and culture.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="OtherUniverses">Other Universes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mojiverse, with each <a href="../moji/">Moji</a> being a species.</li>
  <li>Tileverse, contact lost after an incident.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="Epoch">Multiversal Epoch</h3>
<p>All universes are the result of a single event, the R74n Multiversal Epoch.</p>
<p>For each possible individual outcome, a new universe branched off. This continued until everything that can exist did.</p>
<p>Universes can be classified in a taxonomic tree of parents, siblings, and children.</p>
<p>A lineage consists of all children verses after a point where a discernible standard model of physics developed. (e.g. Sandboxels Lineage)</p>
<p>A universe cluster is a group of universes that share particular properties.</p>
<p>Not all universes have the same dimensions and sizes. Some didn’t even develop time.</p>
<p>There are one-dimensional universes consisting solely of binary data. This allows for immutable data universes that contain every possible string of text or information.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="Timeline">Timeline [Earth]</h2>
<p>All important multiversal events on Earth will be listed here.</p>
<p>May 2nd, 2017: Unreadable transmissions reach Earth from unknown location, designated '<em>R74n</em>'.</p>
<p>May 3rd, 2017: Formation of The High Council of R74n in response to R74n transmission detection.</p>
<p>May 5th, 2017: Construction of the R74n Vault begins on Edgeøya, an island in Svalbard, to keep a record of events.</p>
<p>Mar 2nd, 2021: Obfuscated individual is discovered on Earth.</p>
<p>Mar 7th, 2021: Detection of the first <a href="old">emanation</a> on Earth, the R74n Logo.</p>
<p>Apr 16th, 2021: Detection of further emanations, prompting the creation of the <a href="map/">Emanation Map</a>.</p>
<p>Dec 15th, 2021: R74n transmission code is cracked using <a href="../multiplane/?plane=R0B100-R0B1FF">Formicode</a>, revealing the Boxelverse.</p>
<p>Dec 16th, 2021: Archives of transmissions kept at the R74n Vault are decoded and documented, revealing the existence of the multiverse.</p>
<p>Dec 18th, 2021: The High Council establishes a constant live stream of decoded transmission from the Boxelverse.</p>
<p>Jun 17th, 2024: R74n Vault findings revealed to the public.</p>
<p>Jul 19th, 2025: <a href="../youtube/button">First physical object</a> manifested from an emanation. - For the first time in history, an emanation has manifested into a physical object. A metallic plaque resembling the logo of YouTube, an online video-sharing platform, was extracted off the coast of Svalbard in the Barents Sea. Etched into it was the name “R74n” as foretold by scientists years prior.</p>
