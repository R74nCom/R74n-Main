### Sandboxels

Sandboxels is a falling-sand simulator playable in any web browser.

It brings nostalgia to players of old falling-sand games. This modern take on the genre has a strong focus on chemistry, life, and even food.

Players are allowed to freely experiment with over 500 different materials — liquids, powders, metals, plants, bugs, gases, and more — and see how they interact with each other in real time.
