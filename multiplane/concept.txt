(i)R00007     - Slot 7 in the Imaginary dimension

Dimension - Modifier to a code in the default multiplane
Multiplane - Huge 2D area; Contains planes; Has 1048575 slots each
Plane - Large section of a multiplane; Varying size
Block - Section of a plane; Varying size
Row - Collection of 16 slots, 0-F; The n in R0000n
Slot - One cell in a row which can be allocated to an entity

Allocation - When an single entity is given a code
Code Update - When multiple entities are given codes
Reservation - Empty codes that serve a preemptive purpose
Union - Set of two codes or other unions that form a new concept - e.g. R00001+(i)R00007

Dimensions starting with "x" (e.g. (xtest)) can be user-assigned and used for whatever purpose without necessarily correlating to the default dimension.
There are 65536 user-assigned codes from RF0000-RFFFFF, at the end of the multiplane.
