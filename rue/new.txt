= Text Parser =
- Commands can be typed like functions. For example:
    sort(b,c,g,b,e,a,f)
    length(testing
- If the argument "this" is passed to a command, it will be replaced with the last text you highlighted. (e.g. translate this)
- If summoned via the bookmarklet, an empty message will hide Rue
